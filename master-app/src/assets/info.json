The typical orientations for hex grids are vertical columns (flat topped) and horizontal rows (pointy topped).Hexagons have 6 sides and 6 corners. Each side is shared by 2 hexagons. Each corner is shared by 3 hexagons. For more about centers, sides, and corners, see my article on grid parts (squares, hexagons, and triangles)."

                "parag": "In a regular hexagon the interior angles are 120°. There are six “wedges”, each an equilateral triangle with 60° angles inside. Each corner is size units away from the center. In code:function pointy_hex_corner(center, size, i):var angle_deg = 60 * i - 30°var angle_rad = PI / 180 * angle_degreturn Point(center.x + size * cos(angle_rad),center.y + size * sin(angle_rad))To fill a hexagon, gather the polygon vertices at hex_corner(…, 0) through hex_corner(…, 5). To draw a hexagon outline, use those vertices, and then draw a line back to hex_corner(…, 0).The difference between the two orientations is a rotation, and that causes the angles to change: flat topped angles are 0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300° and pointy topped angles are 30°, 90°, 150°, 210°, 270°, 330°. Note that the diagrams on this page use the y axis pointing down (angles increase clockwise); you may have to make some adjustments if your y axis points up (angles increase counterclockwise).In math, the "circumradius" is the distance from the center to a corner (I call this size); the "inradius" is the distance from the center to the middle of an edge. The "maximal diameter" is twice the circumradius; the "minimal diameter" is twice the inradius. Wikipedia has more."
